            <p>After a career as an <span className="font-bold">Artistic Director, Anas Mahmood</span> decided to create his own company in 2019 with design and audiovisual (video) creation as its core activity.</p>
            <p>This idea of combining design and video gave birth to the name.<span className="font-bold">“ACM”</span>Like a laboratory, we mix two universes to create a new one.</p>
            <p>The opportunities followed one another and since 2020, Le Lab has acquired a new skill: <span className="font-bold">mastery of the air.</span> Following training and obtaining an official certificate <span className="font-bold">issued by the DGAC, ACM</span>  obtained the title of approved remote pilot and can carry out all types of aerial plans in complete legality and safety.</p>
            <p>Today, ACM is a contact,a trusted person who carries out your missions in Bordeaux as elsewhere with <spam className="font-bold">professional equipment, know-how, strong skills and of course kindness.</spam></p>
